Sample Website to Test Google Vision API
----------------------------------------

This creates a sample website which allows the user to pick a video stream from your device and send it to an endpoint for processing. For example, your own custom [Google Cloud Function](https://github.com/haoyee-dev/image_recognition_cloud_function).

Much thanks goes to the [WebRTC sample](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/devices/input-output/) for their demo and sample code for using media devices through HTML5.
